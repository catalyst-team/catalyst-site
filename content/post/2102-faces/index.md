title: Representation Learning and Faces
date: 2021-02-04
summary: "During the last two years, there was enormous progress in representation learning through the Face Recognition task. Starting from well-known ArcFace in 2018, there were a few other “Faces”: SubCenterArcFace, CosFace, AdaCos, CurricularFace, and more. In this post, we would dive into “Faces”, introduce their intuition, and compare them on a small toy task."
